Networks of spiking neurons capture the underlying biophysics of neuronal circuits, yet the dependence of their activity on model parameters is notoriously complex. As a result, heuristic methods have been used to configure spiking network models, which can lead to an inability to discover activity regimes complex enough to match large-scale neuronal recordings. Here we propose an automatic procedure, Spiking Network Optimization using Population Statistics (SNOPS), to customize spiking network models that reproduce the population-wide covariability of large-scale neuronal recordings. We first confirmed that SNOPS accurately recovers simulated neural activity statistics. Then, we applied SNOPS to recordings in macaque visual and prefrontal cortices and discovered previously unknown limitations of spiking network models. Taken together, SNOPS can guide the development of network models and thereby enable deeper insight into how networks of neurons give rise to brain function.', 'published': 'NA', 'node': 90091, 'link_page': 'https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.21.558920v1?versioned=TRUE', 'link_pdf': 'https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.21.558920v1.full.pdf'}\n",

Angiogenesis drives postnatal lung development. Therefore, we profiled the transcriptional ontogeny and sensitivity to injury of pulmonary endothelial cells (EC) during early postnatal life. Although subtype speciation was evident at birth, immature lung EC exhibited transcriptomes distinct from mature counterparts, which progressed dynamically over time. Gradual, temporal changes in aerocyte capillary EC (CAP2), contrasted with more marked alterations in general capillary EC (CAP1) phenotype, including distinct CAP1 present only in the early alveolar lung expressing Peg3, a paternally imprinted transcription factor. Hyperoxia, an injury which impairs angiogenesis, induced both common and unique endothelial gene signatures, dysregulated capillary EC cross-talk, and suppressed CAP1 proliferation while stimulating venous EC proliferation. These data highlight the diversity, transcriptomic evolution, and pleiotropic responses to injury of immature lung EC, possessing broad implications for lung development and injury across the lifespan.', 'published': 'NA', 'node': 2159, 'link_page': 'https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.27.441649v2?versioned=TRUE', 'link_pdf': 'https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.27.441649v2.full.pdf'}\n",

This requires interpreting the variations and, in many occasions, producing changes in gene expression. In this paper we use information theory and a simple transcription model to analyze the extent to which the resulting gene expression is able to identify and assess the intensity of extracellular stimuli when they are encoded in the amplitude, duration or frequency of a transcription factors nuclear concentration. We find that the maximal information transmission is, for the three codifications, ~ 1.5 - 1.8 bits, i.e., approximately 3 ranges of input strengths can be distinguished in all cases. The types of promoters that yield maximum transmission for the three modes are all similarly fast and have a high activation threshold. The three input modulation modes differ, however, in the sensitivity to changes in the parameters that characterize the promoters, with frequency modulation being the most sensitive and duration modulation, the least. This turns out to be key for signal identification. Namely, we show that, because of this sensitivity difference, it is possible to find promoter parameters that yield an information transmission within 90% of its maximum value for duration or amplitude modulation and less than 1 bit for frequency modulation. The reverse situation cannot be found within the framework of a single promoter transcription model. This means that pulses of transcription factors in the nucleus can selectively activate the promoter that is tuned to respond to frequency modulations while prolonged nuclear accumulation would activate several promoters at the same time. Thus, frequency modulation is better suited than the other encoding modes to allow the identification of external stimuli without requiring other mediators of the transduction.', 'published': 'NA', 'node': 43301, 'link_page': 'https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.06.511167v1?versioned=TRUE', 'link_pdf': 'https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.06.511167v1.full.pdf'}\n",

The C/EBP-induced B cell to macrophage transdifferentiation (BMT) is a powerful system to address this question. Here we describe that C/EBP with a single arginine mutation (C/EBPR35A) induces a dramatically accelerated BMT in mouse and human cells. Changes in the expression of lineage-restricted genes occur as early as within 1 hour compared to 18 hours with the wild type. Mechanistically C/EBPR35A exhibits an increased affinity for PU.1, a bi-lineage transcription factor required for C/EBP-induced BMT. The complex induces more rapid chromatin accessibility changes and an enhanced relocation (stealing) of PU.1 from B cell to myeloid gene regulatory elements. Arginine 35 is methylated by Carm1 and inhibition of the enzyme accelerates BMT, similar to the mutant. Our data suggest that the relative proportions of methylated and unmethylated C/EBP in a bipotent progenitor can determine the velocity of cell fate choice and lineage directionality.', 'published': '10.7554/elife.83951', 'node': 42509, 'link_page': 'https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.03.510647v1?versioned=TRUE', 'link_pdf': 'https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.03.510647v1.full.pdf'}\n",

It remains unclear, however, if and how they affect gene expression. Here, we disrupted the formation of two prominent endogenous transcription bodies that mark the onset of zygotic transcription in zebrafish embryos and analysed the effect on gene expression using enriched SLAM-Seq and live-cell imaging. We find that the disruption of transcription bodies results in downregulation of hundreds of genes, providing experimental support for a model in which transcription bodies increase the efficiency of transcription. We also find that a significant number of genes are upregulated, counter to the suggested stimulatory effect of transcription bodies. These upregulated genes have accessible chromatin and are poised to be transcribed in the presence of the two transcription bodies, but they do not go into elongation. Live-cell imaging shows that the disruption of the two large transcription bodies enables these poised genes to be transcribed in ectopic transcription bodies, suggesting that the large transcription bodies sequester a pause release factor. Supporting this hypothesis, we find that CDK9, the kinase that releases paused polymerase II, is highly enriched in the two large transcription bodies. Importantly, overexpression of CDK9 in wild type embryos results in the formation of ectopic transcription bodies and thus phenocopies the removal of the two large transcription bodies. Taken together, our results show that transcription bodies regulate transcription genome-wide: the accumulation of transcriptional machinery creates a favourable environment for transcription locally, while depriving genes elsewhere in the nucleus from the same machinery.', 'published': 'NA', 'node': 49272, 'link_page': 'https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.21.517317v1?versioned=TRUE', 'link_pdf': 'https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.21.517317v1.full.pdf'}\n",

With its ease of genetic manipulation and growth, supported by in-depth functional annotation in the PomBase database and genome-wide metabolic models, S. pombe is an attractive option for synthetic biology applications. However, S. pombe currently lacks modular tools for generating genetic circuits with more than one transcriptional unit. We have developed a toolkit to address this issue. Adapted from the MoClo- YTK plasmid kit for Saccharomyces cerevisiae and using the same Golden Gate grammar, our POMBOX toolkit is designed to facilitate the fast, efficient and modular construction of genetic circuits in S. pombe. It allows for interoperability when working with DNA sequences that are functional in both S. cerevisiae and S. pombe (e.g. protein tag, antibiotic resistance cassette, coding sequences). Moreover, POMBOX enables the modular assembly of multi-gene pathways and increases possible pathway length from 6 to 12 transcriptional units. We also adapted the stable integration vector homology arms to Golden Gate assembly and tested the genomic integration success rate depending on different sequence sizes, from four to twenty-four kilobases. We included fourteen S. pombe promoters that we characterized for two fluorescent proteins, in both minimal defined media (EMM2) and complex media (YES). Then we tested six S. cerevisiae and six synthetic terminators in S. pombe. Finally, we used the POMBOX kit for a synthetic biology application in metabolic engineering and expressed plant enzymes in S. pombe to produce specialized metabolite precursors, namely methylxanthine, amorpha-4,11-diene and cinnamic acid from the purine, mevalonate and amino acid pathways.', 'published': 'NA', 'node': 74136, 'link_page': 'https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.24.542151v1?versioned=TRUE', 'link_pdf': 'https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.24.542151v1.full.pdf'}\n",

Although the current rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections has decreased significantly; the long-term outlook of COVID-19 remains a serious cause of high death worldwide; with the mortality rate still surpassing even the worst mortality rates recorded for the influenza viruses. The continuous emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), including multiple heavily mutated Omicron sub-variants, have prolonged the COVID-19 pandemic and outlines the urgent need for a next-generation vaccine that will protect from multiple SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.\\n\\nMethodsIn the present study, we designed a multi-epitope-based Coronavirus vaccine that incorporated B, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell epitopes conserved among all known SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and selectively recognized by CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells from asymptomatic COVID-19 patients irrespective of VOC infection. The safety, immunogenicity, and cross-protective immunity of this pan-Coronavirus vaccine were studied against six VOCs using an innovative triple transgenic h-ACE-2-HLA-A2/DR mouse model.\\n\\nResultsThe Pan-Coronavirus vaccine: (i) is safe; (ii) induces high frequencies of lung-resident functional CD8+ and CD4+ TEM and TRM cells; and (iii) provides robust protection against virus replication and COVID-19-related lung pathology and death caused by six SARS-CoV-2 VOCs: Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma or P1 (B.1.1.28.1), Delta (lineage B.1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529). Conclusions: A multi-epitope pan-Coronavirus vaccine bearing conserved human B and T cell epitopes from structural and non-structural SARS-CoV-2 antigens induced cross-protective immunity that cleared the virus, and reduced COVID-19-related lung pathology and death caused by multiple SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.', 'published': 'NA', 'node': 74123, 'link_page': 'https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.24.541850v1?versioned=TRUE', 'link_pdf': 'https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.24.541850v1.full.pdf'}\n",

In addition to distinguishing one nucleobase from another, some transcription factors can distinguish between unmodified and modified bases. Current models of transcription factor binding tend not take DNA modifications into account, while the recent few that do often have limitations. This makes a comprehensive and accurate profiling of transcription factor affinities difficult.\\n\\nHere, we developed methods to identify transcription factor binding sites in modified DNA. Our models expand the standard A/C/G/T DNA alphabet to include cytosine modifications. We developed Cytomod to create modified genomic sequences and enhanced the Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation (MEME) Suite by adding the capacity to handle custom alphabets. We adapted the well-established position weight matrix (PWM) model of transcription factor binding affinity to this expanded DNA alphabet.\\n\\nUsing these methods, we identified modification-sensitive transcription factor binding motifs. We confirmed established binding preferences, such as the preference of ZFP57 and C/EBP{beta} for methylated motifs and the preference of c-Myc for unmethylated E-box motifs. Using known binding preferences to tune model parameters, we discovered novel modified motifs for a wide array of transcription factors. Finally, we validated predicted binding preferences of OCT4 using cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (CUT&RUN) experiments across conventional, methylation-, and hydroxymethylation-enriched sequences. Our approach readily extends to other DNA modifications. As more genome-wide single-base resolution modification data becomes available, we expect that our method will yield insights into altered transcription factor binding affinities across many different modifications.\",\n",
