# Contributing

In order to be able to contribute, it is important that you understand
the project layout.
This project uses the *src layout*, which means that the package code is located
at `./src/rxiv_rest_api`.

For my information, check the official documentation:
https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/discussions/src-layout-vs-flat-layout/

In addition, you should know that to build our package we use
[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), it's a Python package management tool that
simplifies the process of building and publishing Python packages. It allows us
to easily manage dependencies, virtual environments and package versions. Poetry
also includes features such as dependency resolution, lock files and publishing
to PyPI. Overall, Poetry streamlines the process of managing Python packages,
making it easier for us to create and share our code with others.

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit
helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways:

## Types of Contributions

### Report Bugs

Report bugs at https://github.com/xmnlab/rxiv-restapi.git/issues.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

  - Your operating system name and version.
  - Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in
    troubleshooting.
  - Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with “bug” and
“help wanted” is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with
“enhancement” and “help wanted” is open to whoever wants to implement
it.

### Write Documentation

rXiv REST API could always use more documentation,
whether as part of the official rXiv REST API docs,
in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at
https://github.com/xmnlab/rxiv-restapi.git/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

  - Explain in detail how it would work.
  - Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to
    implement.
  - Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that
    contributions are welcome :)

## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here’s how to set up `rxiv-rest-api` for local development.

1.  Fork the `rxiv-rest-api` repo on GitHub.

2.  Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/rxiv-rest-api.git

3.  Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have
    virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for
    local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv rxiv-rest-api
    $ cd rxiv-rest-api/
    $ python setup.py develop

4.  Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

    Now you can make your changes locally.

5.  When you’re done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8
    and the tests, including testing other Python versions with tox::

    $ make lint
    $ make test

    To get flake8 and tox, just pip install them into your virtualenv.

6.  Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add . $ git commit -m “Your detailed description of your
    changes.” $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7.  Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1.  The pull request should include tests.
2.  If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.
    Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add
    the feature to the list in README.rst.
3.  The pull request should work for Python >= 3.8.

## Tips

To run a subset of tests::
```
$ pytest tests.test_rxiv_rest_api
```


## Release

This project uses semantic-release in order to cut a new release
based on the commit-message.

### Commit message format

**semantic-release** uses the commit messages to determine the consumer
impact of changes in the codebase. Following formalized conventions for
commit messages, **semantic-release** automatically determines the next
[semantic version](https://semver.org) number, generates a changelog and
publishes the release.

By default, **semantic-release** uses [Angular Commit Message
Conventions](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-format).
The commit message format can be changed with the `preset` or `config`
options_ of the
[@semantic-release/commit-analyzer](https://github.com/semantic-release/commit-analyzer#options)
and
[@semantic-release/release-notes-generator](https://github.com/semantic-release/release-notes-generator#options)
plugins.

Tools such as [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) or
[commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) can
be used to help contributors and enforce valid commit messages.

The table below shows which commit message gets you which release type
when `semantic-release` runs (using the default configuration):

| Commit message                                                 | Release type     |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| `fix(pencil): stop graphite breaking when pressure is applied` | Fix Release      |
| `feat(pencil): add 'graphiteWidth' option`                     | Feature Release  |
| `perf(pencil): remove graphiteWidth option`                    | Chore            |
| `BREAKING CHANGE: The graphiteWidth option has been removed`   | Breaking Release |

As this project uses the `squash and merge` strategy, ensure to apply
the commit message format to the PR's title.
